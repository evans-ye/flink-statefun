# Smoke E2E Test

## Runtime Architecture

```
CommandFlinkSource -> StateFun Core -> SocketSink -> SimpleVerificationServer
(CommandGenerator)         ^
                           |
                           Ë‡
                     Remote Functions
                   (CommandInterpreter)
```

## Framework Modules
### statefun-e2e-tests-common
The generic ``StatefulFunctionsAppContainers`` implementation which is used to spawn up the Flink cluster and other external services(such as remote functions or Kafka) as Docker containers.

### statefun-smoke-e2e-common
Testing utilities:
* ``SmokeRunner``: facet class that organizes the Smoke E2E runtime architecture.
* ``SimpleVerificationServer``: takes the ``VerificationResult`` messages and performs the verification.

### statefun-smoke-e2e-driver
The core logic of the testing framework which generates a series of command and verification messages via ``CommandGenerator``.
The driver code here is built into a self-contained jar that can be loaded and ran by the Flink StateFun cluster directly. 

### statefun-smoke-e2e-multilang-base
This module contains a generic ``pom.xml`` that have the dependencies and the driver jar downloaded to run Smoke E2E.

### statefun-smoke-e2e-multilang-harness
The harness test that can be ran directly by JUnit. Noted that one should have a remote function running at localhost 8000 port before running the harness test.

# Adding Smoke E2E for a Language SDK
For the steps below, take _statefun-smoke-e2e-golang_ module as a reference implementation. You can copy the static config files from there as well.

## Step 1: Add a new module
* Make _statefun-smoke-e2e-multilang-base_ as parent of new module's ``pom.xml``.
```
    <parent>
        <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
        <artifactId>statefun-smoke-e2e-multilang-base</artifactId>
        <version>3.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <relativePath>../statefun-smoke-e2e-multilang-base/pom.xml</relativePath>
    </parent>
```
* Copy ``commands.proto`` into ``src/main/protobuf``.
* Copy ``remote-module/module.yaml``, ``Dockerfile``, ``log4j.properties`` into ``src/test/resources``.

## Step 2: Generate the protobuf messages
Generate language specific protobuf message bindings using the ``commands.proto`` definition.

## Step 3: Implement the CommandInterpreterFn and an HTTP endpoint
* Code up ``CommandInterpreterFn`` using the specific language SDK. It's a remote function that performs state manipulation based on the commands received. One can mimic the logic by looking into other Smoke E2E implementations.
* Make sure the typename of remote function, messages, ingress/ingress are all aligned with the driver's definition.
* Wrap the ``CommandInterpreterFn`` as an HTTP endpoint using a simple web container.

## Step 4: Run the Harness Test
* Run Step 3's ``CommandInterpreterFn`` HTTP endpoint at localhost 8000 port.
* Run ``MultiLangSmokeHarnessTest`` under _statefun-smoke-e2e-multilang-harness_ to test out your implementation.

## Step 5: Implement the SmokeVerificationE2E
* Implement the language SDK's version of ``SmokeVerificationE2E``. One should mostly focus on preparing resources for launching language specific HTTP endpoint in the ``configureRemoteFunction`` method.
* Create a ``Dockerfile.remote-function`` under ``src/test/resources``, which takes the resources prepared by ``SmokeVerificationE2E`` and launches the ``CommandInterpreterFn`` HTTP endpoint in the container.
* The ``SmokeRunner`` orchestrates the Smoke E2E runtime by doing the following:
  * Launch the Flink StateFun cluster, which is defined by ``StatefulFunctionsAppContainers.Builder``.
  * Launch ``SimpleVerificationServer`` that collects the verification results.
  * Wait until verification succeed and exit out.
